\section{Knowledge-Based Recommender Systems}\label{chapter:knowledge_based}

Knowledge-based recommenders are the third most popular type of recommender systems \cite{burke2000knowledge}. In this type of recommender, users are explicitly asked to enter criteria for what kind of items they want to see. These information are compared with the items and a recommendation list is returned. More information can be found in the resources \cite{burke2000knowledge} and \cite{felfernig2015constraint}.
