Recommender Systems (RSs) are software tools and techniques that provide suggestions for items that are most likely of interest to a particular user ~\parencite{Ricci2015}. 

Suggestions and items depend on the field that recommder system is applied. For example, for the topic of news article recommenders, the aim will most likely be suggesting news to the readers. In the field of job recommenders though, these suggestions can be bidirectional. Meaning that, job postings can be suggested to applicants or resumes can be recommended to the human resources team of a company.
