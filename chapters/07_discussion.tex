\section{Problems about datasets}

\subsection{Problems about Motius dataset}

Another funny thing in Motius data: pos: android dev. 2 x lorenzo: 1 rejected 1 accepted

To sum up:

Only a small portion of Motius and Freelancer features overlap
Since Motius data doesn't have many data points, those unique features stay untrained
Motius recommender produces duplicates
Many people were selected although they don't meet skill requirements(also on freelancer)
There are some people with many skills entered(for example Lorenzo, over 20) and there are many people that has only 1-2 skills in system
Selected people are not selected because their skills fit better than the others.
