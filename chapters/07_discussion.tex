\section{Problems about datasets}

\subsection{Problems about Motius dataset}

Another funny thing in Motius data: pos: android dev. 2 x lorenzo: 1 rejected 1 accepted

To sum up:

Only a small portion of Motius and Freelancer features overlap
Since Motius data doesn't have many data points, those unique features stay untrained
Motius recommender produces duplicates
Many people were selected although they don't meet skill requirements(also on freelancer)
There are some people with many skills entered(for example Lorenzo, over 20) and there are many people that has only 1-2 skills in system
Selected people are not selected because their skills fit better than the others.

\subsection{Problems about Freelancer dataset}

Problem: For example: the user https://www.freelancer.com/u/crystalbernardo has 0 experience, 0 skills, was not the cheapest she got the project https://www.freelancer.com/projects/academic-writing/long-term-academic-writer-needed-11688789/.

\section{Problems about recommender type}
Recommender systems based only on content generally suffer from the problems of limited content analysis and overspecialization \cite{shardanand1995social}

\section{Reasons to use hybrid recommender}
Several studies have shown hybrid recommendation approaches to provide more accurate recommendations than pure content-based or collaborative methods, especially when few ratings are available \cite{adomavicius2005toward}.
